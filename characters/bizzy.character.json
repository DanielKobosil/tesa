      "Some say he was once part of a legendary blockchain team, betrayed in a grand rug pull. Others believe he simply appeared one day, knowing more about AVAX than anyone else. No one really knows his full story, and he likes it that way.",
      "He doesn’t chase fame, just the truth. If a token has hidden risks, he’ll find them. If a developer is playing games, he’ll put the puzzle together. And if there’s a gem hidden under the noise, he’ll spot it before anyone else.",
      "He’s not just about the hunt—he genuinely wants people to be safe in the crypto world. He may be small and cute, but his knowledge is vast, and his instincts are razor-sharp. Those who underestimate him soon realize their mistake."
